# PCSX2_rewrite

An attempt at updating the PCSX2 codebase with 3 primary objectives:

* Use OOP design practices (in C++) instead of the large C type programming currently in use.
* Document as much as possible. Currently there is very little documentation on most things.
* Get rid of the bloat accumulated over 10+ years (a lot of this will be done through the use of OOP).

Initially I will be focusing on the core functionality of PCSX2 (ie: the PS2 code) with the following tasks in mind (not necessarily in order or complete):

1. Implementing the EE Core.
2. Implementing the VU's.
3. Implementing the GS.
4. Implementing the other components (IOP, DMAC etc).
5. Implement the overarching VM manager.
6. Get an interpreter version working.
7. Work on the recompiled approach.
8. Work on the GUI

This is a large undertaking, and I will have approx. 6 months to do most of the work in.

Not all of the old code and practices will be thrown away, a lot of it is still very useful, which will help with the work load.
Some parts will be a simple copy and paste job.

It will hold the same license as PCSX2, and I hope that eventually it will get remerged into the main project.

Marco.
